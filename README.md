### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good way to practice CSS Grid more. I learned to apply grid-template-areas with different column set-ups for different screen sizes. This allowed for the layout of the components to become more responsive and in my opinion also more visually appealing as the screen size changes.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on my mobile first approach before optimizing the layout of the components for bigger screen sizes.
My goal is to become more efficient in styling with CSS/SASS as well as using CSS Grid/Flexbox to make responsive websites.
